`# Status

Single source of truth for what is built. Update the boxes in the same commit as
the work — a status file that lags is worse than none.

Phases and their exit tests are in `BUILD-PLAN.md`. This file only tracks state.

## Phase 0 — Baseline

- [x] Vite 7 + React 19 + TypeScript
- [x] `WebGPURenderer` with automatic WebGL2 fallback
- [x] TSL node materials
- [x] Backend readout in the HUD
- [x] `.gitignore` reviewed, repo initialised, first push

## Phase 1 — Gates (both block Phase 3)

### Track A — Writing  · Seb
- [x] PolarSense case study (EN)
- [x] Arts by Sandra case study (EN)
- [x] Scrubble case study (EN)
- [x] One-line bio + footer links — `src/i18n/index.ts`, three locales
- [x] FR translations — `*.fr.mdx`, reviewed and approved
- [x] NL translations — `*.nl.mdx`, reviewed and approved

### Track B — Blockout  · Seb
- [x] World layout as data — `src/world.ts`
- [x] Placeholder landmarks at true scale, in engine
- [x] Island geometry under each landmark — `src/Islands.tsx`, lathe + coastline wobble
- [ ] Layout judged by flying it: is traversal interesting or a chore?
- [x] Landmark blockout, in code — `src/Landmarks.tsx`, primitives + TSL, no assets
  - [x] Mine — benches, adit, head-frame with sheave, spoil heap
  - [x] Easel and canvas — A-frame, ledge, blank canvas
  - [x] Scrabble board — slab, rim, 15×15 grid in the shader, played tiles, rack
- [ ] Blender models replacing the code blockout *(moved to Phase 4 — they drop
      in behind `<Landmarks />` without touching `App`)*

## Built ahead of schedule

Needed to run Track B's exit test, so built before Phase 2.

- [x] `useInput()` — invariant 8, keyboard
- [x] Flight controller: damped velocity, shortest-arc yaw, bank on turn
- [x] Held-Space climb to a ceiling and sink back; held-Shift speed boost
- [x] Acceleration-driven spring: lean, pitch and suspension bounce on any change
- [x] Fixed-offset follow camera
- [x] Proximity detection, landmark in range surfaced in the HUD
- [x] `src/Scenery.tsx` — sky, sun, ocean and clouds in TSL, golden hour, zero assets

## Phase 2 — Flat site

- [x] React Router **8**, framework mode, `ssr: false` + `prerender`
      *(v8, not the plan's v7 — see CLAUDE.md, Stack)*
- [x] MDX via `@mdx-js/rollup` + `remark-frontmatter` + `remark-mdx-frontmatter`
- [x] Locale routing `/en /fr /nl` + `hreflang` + canonical (root redirect in nginx)
- [x] `src/i18n/` typed strings per locale — English defines the shape, so a
      missing key in `fr` or `nl` is a type error
- [x] Routes: `/{lang}`, `/{lang}/work`, `/{lang}/work/{slug}`, `/{lang}/404`
- [x] Typography and layout — system stack, one rhythm unit, dark
- [x] Footer — name, one line, email, GitHub
- [x] Deploy tooling — `deploy.sh` (build + rsync + smoke test) and
      `deploy/nginx.conf`, self-hosted instead of Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] First deploy run: `./deploy.sh` *(Seb — server setup steps in README)*
- [ ] DNS A records for `pinchs.be` and `www` → 167.233.245.42
- [ ] TLS via `certbot --nginx`
- [ ] Exit: Lighthouse 100, usable with JS off, live in three languages

### Verified, on a throwaway install in Claude's container

Not on Seb's machine — `npm install` there is forbidden. Re-run after installing.

- [x] `tsc -b` clean under `"strict": true`, which the config had never set
- [x] 19 routes prerendered: 3 locales × (home, work, 3 case studies, 404) + `/world`
- [x] Case studies render in full with JavaScript disabled, styled, no console errors
- [x] `<html lang>`, `hreflang`, `x-default` and canonical correct per locale,
      and canonicals carry no trailing slash
- [x] First-route JS **127 kB gz** (budget 200) · canvas chunk **427 kB gz**
      (budget 600) · CSS 1.6 kB gz
- [x] `three` is in no prerendered document and in no first-route chunk
- [ ] Lighthouse — needs the real deploy

### No webfont

Deliberate, against the plan's "one variable font, subset per locale": zero bytes,
zero requests, no swap, nothing to subset three ways. The craft here is measure,
rhythm and colour. A typeface can land in Phase 4 with the shaders if it earns it.

### Deviations to know about

- `/world` existed, prerendered but unlinked and `noindex`, so Track B's exit
  test was runnable while the flat site shipped. **Retired in Phase 3** — the
  scene is behind `/{lang}` now and an unlinked route had nothing left to hold.
- `src/Scenery.tsx` and `src/Landmarks.tsx` were type-broken against
  `@types/three` 0.185.4 (`Vec3` was aliased to what `vec3()` returns, which is
  narrower than what every operator returns). Fixed, because `npm run build` now
  type-checks first.
- `index.html`, `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.css` are gone — framework mode owns
  the document.
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` removed: React Router's Vite plugin does refresh itself.

### New dependencies

| Package | Why | Runtime cost |
|---|---|---|
| `react-router` | the router, and Phase 3's push-without-remount | in the 127 kB gz above |
| `@react-router/dev` | typegen, build, prerender | build only |
| `@mdx-js/rollup` | content is files | build only |
| `remark-frontmatter`, `remark-mdx-frontmatter` | frontmatter as an export | build only |
| `@types/mdx` | types for `*.mdx` | none |

## Phase 3 — The world

- [x] Canvas moved into the root layout, mounts once — `src/WorldGate.tsx`,
      rendered by `root.tsx` above every route. `/world` is retired
- [x] Landmarks mapped from content, not hardcoded — `src/world.ts` reads
      `PROJECTS`, and the placement is English frontmatter
- [x] Proximity opens a panel and pushes the URL without remounting
- [x] Deep link spawns beside the landmark with its panel open
- [x] Skip link, first in tab order — and it goes to the flat index when the
      world is showing, because there is no "content" below the fold to skip to
- [x] Full keyboard path to every landmark — tab order on the world's home page
      is skip · wordmark · work · FR · NL · the three landmarks · contact
- [x] No-WebGL path: canvas never mounts
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured
- [x] Canvas and models behind a dynamic `import()`
- [x] `?debug`: proximity radii, blockout wireframes, waypoints, backend, fps
- [ ] Exit: walk every route twice, canvas on and canvas forced off, on real
      hardware *(Seb — verified headless below, but 1fps under swiftshader is
      not a judgement of how it feels)*

### How it fits together

`WorldGate` is the whole seam, and it is a function of the URL:

- `isWorldPath()` (`src/i18n/locales.ts`) says the world shows behind `/{lang}`
  and `/{lang}/work/{slug}`, and behind nothing else. The flat index the skip
  link points at, and the 404, are reading surfaces with nothing moving.
- The canvas mounts the first time a route wants it and then never unmounts
  (invariant 3). Routes with no world set `frameloop="never"`, disable
  `useInput` and hide the layer — verified by tagging the `<canvas>` element and
  finding the same one after a round trip through `/en/work`.
- Proximity is an event, not state: `Ship` pushes `/{lang}/work/{slug}` and
  everything else — the panel, the landmark highlight, the ship's own spawn —
  reads the URL back. There is no second copy of "which panel is open".
- Flying out pops the pushed entry rather than adding one, so a lap of the world
  leaves history at two entries, not eight.

### Decisions taken in this phase

- **The panel is a card, not the case study.** Flying into a landmark opens
  title, year, stack, summary and a link out. Seb's call, over rendering the
  full prose in the panel.
- **`?read` is the way out**, and a query rather than client state so it
  survives a reload, a share and the back button. The flat index links carry it.
  A visitor who arrives from a search result on a machine that can run the world
  therefore gets the card first — that is the cost of the choice above, and the
  prerendered document is still the full article for everything without JS.
- **Touch gets no world.** `(pointer: fine)` is part of the mount test. Mobile
  is Phase 6, and a world you cannot steer is worse than no world.
- **The capability probe asks for WebGL2**, not `navigator.gpu`: the property
  existing is not the adapter working, and three's own fallback is WebGL2. An
  earlier version trusted `navigator.gpu` and mounted a canvas that then threw.
- **The HUD lost the landmark label** — the panel says which landmark this is,
  in the right language — and the renderer backend moved behind `?debug`.
- `src/App.tsx` is now `src/Scene.tsx`. `src/routes/world.tsx` is gone; 18
  routes prerender instead of 19.
- **`/` redirects in dev too**, via a four-line `apply: 'serve'` plugin in
  `vite.config.ts`. `/` matches the root route with no child and renders an
  empty document; nginx has always redirected it in production, so the dev
  server was the only place that showed a black screen. Pre-existing, and
  only noticed once `/world` stopped being the URL you type.

### Content gained the world's geometry

`{slug}.en.mdx` now carries `order`, `pos`, `size`, `radius` and `waypoint`
alongside `landmark`, and `src/world.ts` maps them. `pos` and `waypoint` are XZ
only — the plateau height is one constant and does not belong in three files.
PolarSense's waypoint moved from `[-10, 0, -4]` to `[-10.5, -6]`: the old one
was 5.66 out with a radius of 5, so a deep link would have spawned the ship just
outside the landmark it had just opened, and the panel would have closed itself
one frame later. `world.ts` now asserts that in dev, both for the waypoint and
for two islands overlapping.

`Landmarks.tsx` keys its shapes off `landmark`, not off the slug: a slug is a
URL, not a model name, and two projects may want the same shape.

### Needs Seb

- **`worldControls` in `fr` and `nl` is unreviewed** (`src/i18n/index.ts`) — the
  one new UI string this phase added, machine-drafted, and CLAUDE.md says those
  do not ship unreviewed. The French line says ZQSD on purpose: `useInput` reads
  physical key codes, so it is the same three keys under the same fingers.
- Track B's last gate, *is traversal interesting or a chore*, is still open.
  Phase 3 was built over it on Seb's go-ahead; landmark positions are data, so
  moving them touches none of the above.

### Verified, on a throwaway install in Claude's container

Not on Seb's machine — `npm install` there is forbidden. Note that
`react-router typegen` and `oxlint` cannot run from Claude's Linux VM at all:
both ship native bindings built for macOS arm64. `tsc -b` and the checks do run
there, against the types typegen last wrote.

- [x] `tsc -b` clean, `node src/i18n/locales.check.ts` green
- [x] 18 routes prerendered; production build walked at `/en /fr /nl`
- [x] First-route JS **126.8 kB gz** (budget 200) · canvas chunk **422 kB gz**
      (budget 600) · CSS 2.0 kB gz. No `WebGPURenderer` and no scene chunk in
      any prerendered document
- [x] Canvas element identity survives `/en` → `/en/work/polarsense` →
      `/en/work` → back
- [x] Flying into Scrubble pushed `/en/work/scrubble` and opened the card;
      flying out popped back to `/en` with history at the same depth
- [x] Deep link to `/en/work/scrubble` spawned the ship inside the radius with
      the card open, and did not close it
- [x] Card → *read the case study* → `?read`, 964 words of prose, canvas still
      mounted and switched off; back returns to the card
- [x] WebGL2 unavailable: canvas never mounts, the case study is the full
      article, console clean
- [x] Coarse pointer (Pixel 7 profile): no world, full article
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion`: world mounts, nothing drifts
- [x] Tab order and Enter on a landmark link both correct; Space on a focused
      link does not fly the ship
- [ ] Lighthouse — still needs the real deploy

## Phase 4 — Craft

- [x] Detailed models replacing blockout, one at a time
  - [x] Mine — PolarSense. `tools/mine.py`, `src/models/mine.glb`
  - [x] Easel — Arts by Sandra. `tools/easel.py`, `src/models/easel.glb`
  - [x] Board — Scrubble. `tools/board.py`, `src/models/board.glb`
- [ ] TSL shaders derived from what each project does
- [ ] Post-processing
- [ ] GPU compute particles where WebGPU is available
- [ ] Ambient sound, off by default

### The pipeline

Seb's call, over detailing in code: the models are **Blender, scripted**.
One script per landmark — `tools/mine.py`, `tools/easel.py`, `tools/board.py` — running Blender
headless as a Python module (`pip install "bpy==4.5.13"`, which wants Python
3.11). Each writes both a `.blend` to open and sculpt and the `.glb` the site
loads. Re-running rebuilds both, so the script stays the source and the .blend
stays an output rather than a second thing to keep in sync.

`tools/landmark.py` holds what all of them need: the three-space-to-Blender
conversion, a box or cylinder between two points, a slab with three rotations, a
stone, the box-and-triangle gate, and the export and preview steps. Not an
abstraction over landmarks — no base class, no `Landmark` type — just the
fifteen functions each script would otherwise carry a copy of. Extracting it
left `mine.glb` byte-identical.

Nothing about the pipeline in BUILD-PLAN survived contact except its shape:

- **No Draco, no KTX2, no gltf-transform, no gltfjsx.** The raw export is 381 kB
  and **163 kB gzipped**, against a 300 kB budget — so the whole compression
  stage would buy nothing and cost a decoder fetched at runtime. `deploy/nginx.conf`
  gained `model/gltf-binary` in `gzip_types`; that is the entire asset pipeline.
- **The glTF carries geometry and nothing else** — `export_materials='NONE'`, no
  UVs, no tangents. Every surface is still shaded by the TSL in `Landmarks.tsx`.
  The strata are PolarSense's schema and they read world Y, which a baked texture
  cannot; and it keeps the proximity highlight working on a model exactly as it
  works on a blockout, because both ask the same two material sets for their
  colours.
- **Mesh names are the material keys.** `rock_cut`, `frame_easel`,
  `panel_canvases` → the `rock`, `frame` and `panel` materials. Checked twice: an
  unknown prefix is an assertion at build time in `landmark.py` and a
  `console.assert` in dev in the browser, rather than a black mesh found later.
- The adit is a real hole, cut with a boolean, because the saucer hovers at 0.45
  and the portal is 0.92 high: a visitor will fly at it, and a painted-on mouth
  is a promise the world breaks on the first try. The tunnel walls belong to the
  rock mesh, so the strata run from the hillside into the hole.

`tools/mine.py --render out.png` writes three views. Its light is deliberately
**not** the scene's — see the finding below.

### The mine — PolarSense

A terraced cut with a bored adit, a head-frame over the shaft, and the spoil.
The adit is a real hole, cut with a boolean, because the saucer hovers at 0.45
and the portal is 0.92 high: a visitor will fly at it, and a painted-on mouth is
a promise the world breaks on the first try. The tunnel walls belong to the rock
mesh, so the strata run from the hillside into the hole.

### The easel — Arts by Sandra

**Not one easel.** Sandra teaches, sells her own work and rents the studio, and
the case study's own line is "three different conversations, funnelled into one
form she can actually answer". So the landmark is a working corner: a canvas on
the easel, a stretched one waiting on the table, a small finished one leaning on
its end, and the brushes and palette where they were put down. Three canvases,
one place.

**The frontmatter box grew, 2 × 3 × 2 → 3 × 2.7 × 1.6.** A single easel at two
metres, alone on an island of nearly eight, reads as an ornament dropped on a
lawn — the mine fills its box and this filled a fifth of its island. `radius` is
deliberately untouched: it sets both the proximity trigger and the island, and
`waypoint` is 3.6 out, so shrinking it would have moved two more numbers and
changed how the landmark feels to fly into. Undoing all of it is deleting the
`build_table` and `build_props` calls in `main` and putting `size` back.

The canvas on the easel is **blank on purpose**. What resolves on it as the
visitor approaches is the next Phase 4 item — a TSL shader — and anything
legible painted into the model runs straight into invariant 2.

### The board — Scrubble

A board is flat, and that was the problem: the frontmatter box was 6 × 0.4 × 6
and the saucer hovers at 0.45, so the visitor flew over a rug. The mine is three
and a half metres of silhouette, the easel two and a half; this was four hundred
millimetres of nothing.

**The box grew, 6 × 0.4 × 6 → 6 × 1 × 6**, and what fills it is the case study's
own first line — *"the move you played is not the move that was there."* Seven
tiles hang above the empty squares they would have gone in: the bingo nobody at
the table saw, hooked under the played column and running out to the edge. It is
what Scrubble does, it is the only thing that gives this landmark a shape against
the sky, and it is the geometry the *tiles settle into a real word* item
animates. They are stepped and tipped rather than level, because with no shadow
maps height alone does not say "in the air" — a rank of tiles at one height reads
as a plank.

Kept from the blockout, deliberately: the grid and the premium squares stay in
the shader rather than becoming geometry, so the plate is one slab and has to
stay centred on the group origin — the shader reads `positionLocal.xz`. Tiles
are blank; letters are text and text belongs in the DOM (invariant 2), and the
crossword reads from the shape of the cluster. The found tiles are their own
mesh, `panel_found`, so a shader can single them out later without a second
model.

### Measured

| | mine | easel | board |
|---|---|---|---|
| built | 4.90 × 3.29 × 4.78 | 2.94 × 2.61 × 1.25 | 5.96 × 0.98 × 5.96 |
| frontmatter box | 5 × 3.5 × 5 | 3 × 2.7 × 1.6 | 6 × 1 × 6 |
| triangles (budget 25k) | 15,412 | 2,012 | 1,464 |
| gzipped (budget 300 kB) | 163 kB | 24 kB | 11 kB |

All three sit at y −0.06 or above, inside the −0.08 `Landmarks.tsx` allows.
**198 kB gz for the whole world's models**, against a 3 MB budget — the mine is
five sixths of it, and it is a heightfield.
- Canvas chunk **449 kB gz** (budget 600, was 422 — `useGLTF` and `GLTFLoader`
  are the +27; the second and third models added nothing to it). First-route JS
  **unchanged at ~130 kB gz**; no `.glb` is referenced by any prerendered
  document
- `npx tsc -b` clean, `locales.check.ts` green; 18 routes still prerender
- Walked headless under swiftshader at all three case-study URLs: every model
  loads (200) and renders with the TSL materials — including the board's grid
  and premium squares, which are still shader and still line up with the tiles.
  No page errors, console clean but for three's own WebGPU-unavailable notice.
  In dev the box-fit and material-key assertions are silent

### Two frontmatter boxes grew

`size` is a contract, not a description — the island, the proximity radius and
the ship's clearance are sized from it — so both changes are here rather than
quiet: the easel 2 × 3 × 2 → 3 × 2.7 × 1.6, the board 6 × 0.4 × 6 → 6 × 1 × 6.
Neither touches `radius`, so no waypoint moved and nothing about how a landmark
feels to fly into changed. The mine's box is untouched.

### New dependency: none, but drei is now actually used

`@react-three/drei` has been in `package.json` since Phase 0 and imported
nowhere. `useGLTF` is the first thing to use it — caching, Suspense and the
loader for 27 kB gz inside the canvas chunk, against hand-rolling a loader for
one file.

### Finding, and it is not a modelling problem

Rotated into the mine's local space, `Scenery.tsx`'s sun comes from **behind and
to the right** of the landmark. The follow camera is fixed behind the ship and
the ship approaches from the world's centre, so **every surface the visitor can
see is in shadow**, lit by the ambient fill alone — under which a benched rock
face and a smooth one are the same flat grey. BUILD-PLAN predicted this
("landmarks show the camera their shadow side") and deferred it to Phase 4
materials; the strata shader helps, because its banding does not depend on the
light, but it does not fix it.

The honest fixes are all in `Scenery.tsx`, not in a model: swing the sun round to
port-and-forward, or add a second weak directional light from behind the camera.
**Seb's call** — it changes the committed golden-hour look, which is a decision
this document records rather than one Claude should quietly take.
